# Login Demo for iOS

This is a demo application to demonstrate how to use Firebase's authentication in
your iOS app.

To download and setup all necessary SDKs, please run `pod install`. This requires that
[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is installed. 

You will need to create your own Firebase app and [enable the different
authentication
methods](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/guide/user-auth.html#section-providers)
used in this app and update the values in `Login
Demo/ViewController.m`.
